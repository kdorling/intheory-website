  <h1>About Our Brewery</h1>
  <h2 id="our-story">Our Story</h2>
<p>Founded in 2015, we started as a dream between three friends who shared a passion for exceptional beer. What began in a small garage with a homebrew kit has grown into a thriving craft brewery that serves our community with pride.</p>
<p>Every beer we create is a testament to our commitment to quality, creativity, and the art of brewing. We believe that great beer brings people together, and our taproom has become a gathering place where stories are shared and friendships are forged.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="our-philosophy">Our Philosophy</h2>
<p><strong>Quality Over Quantity</strong> - We brew in small batches to ensure every glass meets our exacting standards.</p>
<p><strong>Local First</strong> - We source ingredients from local farmers and suppliers whenever possible, supporting our community and reducing our environmental impact.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation &amp; Tradition</strong> - We honor classic brewing techniques while constantly experimenting with new flavors, styles, and ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Community Focused</strong> - Our brewery is more than a business—it&rsquo;s a community hub where everyone is welcome.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-brewing-process">The Brewing Process</h2>
<p>Crafting exceptional beer is both science and art. Our brewers carefully control every step:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Malt Selection</strong> - We choose the finest malts to create the foundation of flavor</li>
<li><strong>Mashing</strong> - Converting starches to fermentable sugars at precise temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Boiling &amp; Hopping</strong> - Adding hops at strategic intervals for bitterness, flavor, and aroma</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation</strong> - Our yeast works its magic over days or weeks</li>
<li><strong>Conditioning</strong> - Allowing flavors to mature and harmonize</li>
<li><strong>Quality Control</strong> - Rigorous testing ensures consistency and excellence</li>
</ol>
<p>Each batch is tasted, tested, and approved before it reaches your glass.</p>
