## Tasting Notes

Our flagship amber ale strikes the perfect balance between rich malt character and hop complexity. Copper Trail pours a brilliant amber-copper color with a creamy off-white head.

**Aroma:** Toasted caramel, biscuit malt, with hints of citrus and pine from American hops

**Flavor:** Medium-bodied with layers of caramel sweetness, toffee, and bread crust. A gentle hop bitterness provides balance without overwhelming the malt profile.

**Finish:** Clean and crisp with lingering caramel notes and a subtle hoppy dryness that invites another sip.
